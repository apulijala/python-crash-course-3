9-4. Number Served: Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 162). Add an 
attribute called number_served with a default value of 0. Create an instance called
 restaurant from this class. 
Print the number of customers the restaurant has served, and then change this 
value and print it again.
Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number of customers

9-5. Login Attempts: Add an attribute called login_attempts to your User class from 
Exercise 9-3 (page 162). Write a method called increment_login_attempts() that increments 
the value of login_attempts by 1. Write another method called 
reset_login_attempts() that resets the value of login_attempts to 0.
Make an instance of the User class and call increment_login_attempts() several times.
Print the value of login_attempts to make sure it was incremented properly, and 
then call reset_login_attempts(). Print login_attempts again to make sure it was reset to 0.
